# Learn Buffalo

This repo contains the code used in the Learn Buffalo video course.

> Updated Dec. 2023 to work with `go:embed` directive and other changes for Buffalo version <a href="https://github.com/gobuffalo/cli/releases/tag/v0.18.14">18.14</a>

## Part 10: Develop or Deploy with Docker

NOTE: the code change in this branch is limited to the sample docker-compose.yml file. This file is included as an example, as it was written for a project using Postgres, not MariaDB as we used for the previous lessons. It can be modified to use a <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb">MariaDB container</a> instead of Postgres.

* use the Dockerfile generated by the Buffalo CLI
* explore multi-stage Docker builds
* demo modifying the default Dockerfile to use Nginx as web proxy service
* connect to a cloud hosted database
* use docker-compose to run the app and database in separate containers

### Installation

Modify the database.yml file in the root folder to use the database type, database name and password to match your machine.
The current file assumes:
* type: mariadb
* db name: modelsdemo for dev, and modelsdemo_test for test
* db user: buffalo
* password: 'password'

## Buffalo Project
